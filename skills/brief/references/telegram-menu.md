# The `/brief` Telegram menu entry (once per bot)

Who may do this and how the token is handled are in SKILL.md §3; follow that first.

Check first with `getMyCommands` for the human's chat; if `brief` is there, stop. Otherwise call `setMyCommands` scoped to that chat (`{"type": "chat", "chat_id": …}`): the plugin resets the all-private-chats list on every start, and the narrower scope wins. A chat-scoped list replaces that chat's whole menu, so register `brief` together with the plugin's `start`, `help` and `status`.
